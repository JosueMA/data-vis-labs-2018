# xaringan

- Don't ask me how to pronounce it.

- We'll use it to make slides in R Markdown.

- Install it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

You don't have to load it to use it.

# Let's do this

- File ➡️ New File ➡️ R Markdown ➡️ Click OK

--

- Delete everything but YAML

--

.pull-left[

```yaml
---
title: "TADA!"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "May 15, 2018"
output: html_document
---
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```yaml
---
title: "TADA!"
author: "Alison Hill"
date: "May 15, 2018"
output: xaringan::moon_reader
---
```
]

--

- Save. (save, save, save!)

---
# Knit to moon reader

Either:

- Mouse over to `Knit` drop-down menu and select "Knit to moon_reader"

- Or mouse up to "Addins" and select `xaringan`: Infinite Moon Reader. This option does live preview of slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# 🖼
## You should be looking at two slides right now!

---
class: center, middle, inverse


## Using `xaringan`

---
# Edit your slides

- Edit the YAML to personalize.

```yaml
---
title: "Lab 06: CS631"
subtitle: "Tada!-verse"
author: "Alison Hill"
output: xaringan::moon_reader
---
```

--

- The first slide starts right away. 

--

- New slides are separated by three dashes in a row `---` on a line by itself (recommend keeping an empty line before)



---
# Format your slides

If you aren't familiar with CSS, know that you can use the `default` CSS to do the following on the line immediately after the slide break:

- `class:`
    - `inverse`
    - `center` (horizontally)
    - `middle` (vertically)
    - `bottom` (vertically)
    - `top` (default; vertically)

--

You can combine any of these using commas to separate. All my blue background slides are created with:

```
---
class: inverse, middle, center
```

---
# Title your slides
## This font is smaller


Slide titles and text follow Markdown formatting:
- A big title uses `#`
- But you can also use `##`

--

Try creating a new slide that uses a built-in CSS class and has a big title!

```
---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Title your slides
## This font is smaller
```

---
# Two column slides

Another nice built-in CSS feature is `.pull-left[ ]` and `.pull-right[ ]`

Try this:
```
.pull-left[
on your left
]

.pull-right[
on your right
]
```
--

You should see:

.pull-left[
on your left
]

.pull-right[
on your right
]

---
# Make an incremental slide

One of my favorite things about `xaringan` is the ability to make any slide, anywhere, incremental. To do this, use `--` (that is right, two dashes on a line alone- not three which is a slide break!)

```

---
## Do this with a two column slide!

.pull-left[
increment

--

.pull-right[

---
# Full image slides

Use CSS right after slide break (`---`):

- `background-image: url("actual url or file path here")`
- `background-size: cover` --> image is scaled to fit into the slide.
- `background-position:` play with this, in percents

--

Try this in a new slide:

```
---
background-image: url("http://bit.ly/cs631-donkey")
background-size: cover
```

---
background-image: url("http://bit.ly/cs631-donkey")
background-size: cover

---
# Adding images to slides

Use an R chunk (we haven't even done R yet!)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```

---
# Adding images to slides

Set the chunk option to `{r echo = FALSE}` to just show the image:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```

---
## Use images in an incremental two column slide!

.pull-left[

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-pygmy")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://bit.ly/cs631-sheep")
```
]

---
# Now for some R!

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
alison <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Alison" | name == "Allison") %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") 
ggplot(alison, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line()  
```

---
# Control your R

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10.5, fig.height=4}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
alison <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Alison" | name == "Allison") %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") 
ggplot(alison, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line()  
```

Use in your code chunks:
- `fig.width=` (here I did 10.5)
- `fig.height=` (here I did 4)



---
# Control all of your R

You can do this for all code chunks in your **global chunk options**: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      fig.width = 10.5, fig.height = 4, 
                      comment = NA, rows.print = 16)
```

---
# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

- There are 79 [highlight styles](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/)
- Let's look at highlight lines!

# Highlight lines

Use `#<<`!

ggplot(tips) +
  aes(x = tip) +
  geom_histogram(   #<<
